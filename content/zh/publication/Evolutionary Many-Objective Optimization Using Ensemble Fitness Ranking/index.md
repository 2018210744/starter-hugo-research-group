abstract: In this paper, a new framework, called ensemble fitness ranking (EFR), is
  proposed for evolutionary many-objective optimization that allows to work with different
  types of fitness functions and ensemble ranking schemes. The framework aims to rank
  the solutions in the population more appropriately by combing the ranking results
  from many simple individual rankers. As to the form of EFR, it can be regarded as
  an extension of average and maximum ranking methods which have been shown promising
  for many-objective problems. The significant change is that EFR adopts more general
  fitness functions instead of objective functions, which would make it easier for
  EFR to balance the convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization. In
  the experimental studies, the influence of several fitness functions and ensemble
  ranking schemes on the performance of EFR is fist investigated. Afterwards, EFR
  is compared with two state-of-the-art methods (MOEA/D and NSGA-III) on well-known
  test problems. The computational results show that EFR significantly outperforms
  MOEA/D and NSGA-III on most instances, especially for those having a high number
  of objectives.
