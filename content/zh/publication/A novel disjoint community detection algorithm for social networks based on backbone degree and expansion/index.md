abstract: Community detection in social networks is a key point to discover the functions
  and structure of social networks. A great deal of work has been done for overlapping
  community detection and disjoint community detection, and numerous techniques such
  as spectral clustering, modularity maximization, random walks, differential equation,
  and statistical mechanics are used to identify a community in networks, but most
  of these work adopts pure mathematic and physical methods to discover communities
  from social networks, on the contrary ignoring the social and biological properties
  of communities and social networks. In this paper, firstly we propose the community
  forest model based on these social and biological properties to characterize the
  structure of real-world large-scale networks, secondly we mainly define a new metric
  named backbone degree to measure the strength of the edge and the similarity of
  vertices and give a new sense definition to community based on expansion, thirdly
  we develop a novel algorithm that based on backbone degree and expansion to discover
  disjoint communities from real social networks. This algorithm has better performance
  and effects compared with CNM and GN algorithms in computational cost and visibility.
  It has worked well on Email-Enron, American College Football, karate club etc. data
  sets.
