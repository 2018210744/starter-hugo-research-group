abstract: This paper is an empirical study of unsupervised sentiment classification
  of Chinese reviews. The focus is on exploring the ways to improve the performance
  of the unsupervised sentiment classification based on limited existing sentiment
  resources in Chinese. On the one hand, all available Chinese sentiment lexicons
  — individual and combined — are evaluated under our proposed framework. On the other
  hand, the domain dependent sentiment noise words are identified and removed using
  unlabeled data, to improve the classification performance. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first such attempt. Experiments have been conducted on three open datasets
  in two domains, and the results show that the proposed algorithm for sentiment noise
  words removal can improve the classification performance significantly.
