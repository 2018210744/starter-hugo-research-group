abstract: Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are stochastic optimization
  methods that guide the search by building and sampling probabilistic models. Inspired
  by Bayesian inference, we proposed a two-level hierarchical model based on beta
  distribution. Beta distribution is the conjugate priori for binomial distribution.
  Besides, we introduced a learning rate function into the framework to control the
  model update. To demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed
  algorithm, experiments are carried out on the 01-knapsack problems. Experimental
  results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms cGA, PBIL and QEA.
