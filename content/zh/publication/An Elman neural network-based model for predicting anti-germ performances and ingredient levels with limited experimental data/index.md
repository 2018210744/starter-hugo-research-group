abstract: Anti-germ performance test is critical in the production of detergents.
  However, actual biochemical tests are often costly and time-consuming. In this paper,
  we present an Elman neural network-based model to predict detergentsâ€™ anti-germ
  performance and ingredient levels, respectively. The model made it much faster and
  cost effective than doing actual biochemical tests. We also present preprocessing
  methods that can reduce data conflicts while keeping the monotonicity on limited
  experimental data. The model can find out the relationship between ingredient levels
  and the corresponding anti-germ performance, which is not widely used in solving
  biochemical problems. The results of experiments are generated on the base of two
  detergent products for two types of bacteria, and appear reasonable according to
  natural rules. The prediction results show a high accuracy and fitting with the
  monotonicity rule mostly.
