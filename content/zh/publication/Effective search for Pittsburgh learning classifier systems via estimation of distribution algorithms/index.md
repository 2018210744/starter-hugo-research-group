abstract: Pittsburgh-style learning classifier systems (LCSs), in which an entire
  candidate solution is represented as a set of variable number of rules, combine
  supervised learning with genetic algorithms (GAs) to evolve rule-based classification
  models. It has been shown that standard crossover operators in GAs do not guarantee
  an effective evolutionary search in many sophisticated problems that contain strong
  interactions between features. In this paper, we propose a Pittsburgh-style learning
  classifier system based on the Bayesian optimization algorithm with the aim of improving
  the effectiveness and efficiency of the rule structure exploration. In the proposed
  method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the lower level,
  single rules contained in classifiers are produced by sampling Bayesian networks
  which characterize the global statistical information extracted from the current
  promising rules in the search space. At the higher level, classifiers are recombined
  by rule-wise uniform crossover operators to keep the semantics of rules in each
  classifier. Experimental studies on both artificial and real world binary classification
  problems show that the proposed method converges faster while achieving solutions
  with the same or even higher accuracy compared with the original Pittsburgh-style
  LCSs.
