abstract: Emotion analysis and emotion cause extraction are key research tasks in
  natural language processing and public opinion mining. This paper presents a rule-based
  approach to emotion cause component detection for Chinese micro-blogs. Our research
  has important scientific values on social network knowledge discovery and data mining.
  It also has a great potential in analyzing the psychological processes of consumers.
  Firstly, this paper proposes a rule-based system underlying the conditions that
  trigger emotions based on an emotional model. Secondly, this paper extracts the
  corresponding cause events in fine-grained emotions from the results of events,
  actions of agents and aspects of objects. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to get the
  proportions of different cause components under different emotions by constructing
  the emotional lexicon and identifying different linguistic features, and the proposed
  approach is based on Bayesian probability. Finally, this paper presents the experiments
  on an emotion corpus of Chinese micro-blogs. The experimental results validate the
  feasibility of the approach. The existing problems and the further works are also
  present at the end.
