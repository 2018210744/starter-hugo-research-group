abstract: In sentiment analysis of product reviews, one important problem is to produce
  a summary of opinions based on product features/attributes (also called aspects).
  However, for the same feature, people can express it with many different words or
  phrases. To produce a useful summary, these words and phrases, which are domain
  synonyms, need to be grouped under the same feature group. Although several methods
  have been proposed to extract product features from reviews, limited work has been
  done on clustering or grouping of synonym features. This paper focuses on this task.
  Classic methods for solving this problem are based on unsupervised learning using
  some forms of distributional similarity. However, we found that these methods do
  not do well. We then model it as a semi-supervised learning problem. Lexical characteristics
  of the problem are exploited to automatically identify some labeled examples. Empirical
  evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
  methods by a large margin.
