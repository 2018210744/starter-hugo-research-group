abstract: Overlapping community detection is the key research work to discover and
  explore the social networks. A great deal of work has been devoted to detect overlapping
  communities, but no one can give a clear formula definition of community from the
  internal structure to the external boundary. More in depth, there are four challenges
  to existing research works. In this paper, firstly we propose overlapping community
  forest model and disjoint community forest model based on the community forest model,
  secondly give a clear formula definition of overlapping community and disjoint community
  based on the backbone degree and expansion, thirdly propose a novel algorithm to
  find overlapping communities based on the backbone degree and expansion to resolve
  the four challenges. This algorithm has better performance than four related algorithms
  mentioned by this paper in large scale social networks. It works well on American
  college football, Zacharyâ€™s Karate Club, Netscience-coauthor, Condensed matter collaborations,
  LFR etc. data sets.
