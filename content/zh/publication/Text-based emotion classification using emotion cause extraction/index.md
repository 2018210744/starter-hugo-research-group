abstract: In recent years, increasing impact of social networks on peopleâ€™s opinions
  and decision making has attracted lots of attention. Microblogging, one of the most
  popular social network applications that allows people to share ideas and discuss
  over various topics, is taken as a rich resource of opinion and emotion data. In
  this paper, we propose and implement a novel method for identifying emotions in
  microblog posts. Unlike traditional approaches which are mostly based on statistical
  methods, we try to infer and extract the reasons of emotions by importing knowledge
  and theories from other fields such as Sociology. Based on the theory that a triggering
  cause event is an integral part of emotion, the technique of emotion cause extraction
  is used as a crucial step to improve the quality of selected features. First, after
  thorough analysis on sample data we constructed an automatic rule-based system to
  detect and extract the cause event of each emotional post. We build an emotion corpus
  with Chinese microblog posts labeled by human annotators. Then a classifier is trained
  to classify emotions in microblog posts based on extracted cause events. The overall
  performance of our system is very promising. The experiment results show that our
  approach is effective in selecting informative features. Our system outperformed
  the baseline noticeably in most cases, suggesting its great potential. This exploration
  should provide a new way to look at the emotion classification task and lay the
  ground for future research on textual emotion processing.
