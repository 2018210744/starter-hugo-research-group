abstract: 'Since microblog service became information provider on web scale, research
  on microblog has begun to focus more on its content mining. Most research on microblog
  context is often based on topic models, such as: Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA)
  and its variations. However,there are some challenges in previous research. On one
  hand, the number of topics is fixed as a priori, but in real world, it is input
  by the users. On the other hand, it ignores the hierarchical information of topics
  and cannot grow structurally as more data are observed. In this paper, we propose
  a semi-supervised hierarchical topic model, which aims to explore more reasonable
  topics in the data space by incorporating some constraints into the modeling process
  that are extracted automatically. The new method is denoted as constrained hierarchical
  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (constrained-hLDA). We conduct experiments on Sina microblog,
  and evaluate the performance in terms of clustering and empirical likelihood. The
  experimental results show that constrained-hLDA has a significant improvement on
  the interpretability, and its predictive ability is also better than that of hLDA.'
