abstract: This paper proposes hybrid differential evolution (HDE) algorithms for solving
  the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) with the criterion to minimize the
  makespan. Firstly, a novel conversion mechanism is developed to make the differential
  evolution (DE) algorithm that works on the continuous domain adaptive to explore
  the problem space of the discrete FJSP. Secondly, a local search algorithm based
  on the critical path is embedded in the DE framework to balance the exploration
  and exploitation by enhancing the local searching ability. In addition, in the local
  search phase, the speed-up method to find an acceptable schedule within the neighborhood
  structure is presented to improve the efficiency of whole algorithms. Extensive
  computational results and comparisons show that the proposed algorithms are very
  competitive with the state of the art, some new best known solutions for well known
  benchmark instances have even been found.
