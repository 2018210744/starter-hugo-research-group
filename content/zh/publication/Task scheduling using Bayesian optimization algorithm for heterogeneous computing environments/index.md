abstract: Abstract Efficient task scheduling, as a crucial step to achieve high performance
  for multiprocessor platforms, remains one of the challenge problems despite of numerous
  studies. This paper presents a novel scheduling algorithm based on the Bayesian
  optimization algorithm (BOA) for heterogeneous computing environments. In the proposed
  algorithm, scheduling is divided into two phases. First, according to the task graph
  of multiprocessor scheduling problems, Bayesian networks are initialized and learned
  to capture the dependencies between different tasks. And the promising solutions
  assigning tasks to different processors are generated by sampling the Bayesian network.
  Second, the execution sequence of tasks on the same processor is set by the heuristic-based
  priority used in the list scheduling approach. The proposed algorithm is evaluated
  and compared with the related approaches by means of the empirical studies on random
  task graphs and benchmark applications. The experimental results show that the proposed
  algorithm is able to deliver more efficient schedules. Further experiments indicate
  that the proposed algorithm maintains almost the same performance with different
  parameter settings.
