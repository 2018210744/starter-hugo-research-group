abstract: Micro-blog emotion mining and emotion cause extraction are essential in
  social network data mining. This paper presents a novel approach on Chinese micro-blog
  emotion cause detection based on the ECOCC model, focusing on mining factors for
  eliciting some kinds of emotions. In order to do so, the corresponding emotion causes
  are extracted. Moreover, the proportions of different cause components under different
  emotions are also calculated by means of combining the emotional lexicon with multiple
  characteristics (e.g., emoticon, punctuation, etc.). Experimental results show the
  feasibility of the approach. The proposed approaches have important scientific values
  on social network knowledge discovery and data mining.
