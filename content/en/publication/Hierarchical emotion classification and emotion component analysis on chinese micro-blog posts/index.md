abstract: Text emotion analysis has long been a hot topic. With the development of
  social network, text emotion analysis on micro-blog posts becomes a new trend in
  recent years. However, most researchers classify posts into coarse-grained emotion
  classes, which cannot depict the emotions accurately. Besides, flat classification
  is mostly adopted, which brings difficulty for classifiers when given a large dataset.
  In this paper, by data preprocessing, feature extraction and feature selection,
  we classify Chinese micro-blog posts into fine-grained emotion classes, employing
  hierarchical classification to improve the performance of classifiers. Moreover,
  based on the regression values in classification procedure, we propose an algorithm
  to detect the principal emotions in posts and calculate their ratios.
