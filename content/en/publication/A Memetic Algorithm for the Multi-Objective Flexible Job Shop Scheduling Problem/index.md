abstract: In this paper, a new memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed for the muti-objective
  flexible job shop scheduling problem (MO-FJSP) with the objectives to minimize the
  makespan, total workload and critical workload. By using well-designed chromosome
  encoding/decoding scheme and genetic operators, the non-dominated sorting genetic
  algorithm II (NSGA-II) is first adapted for the MO-FJSP. Then the MA is developed
  by incorporating a novel local search algorithm into the adapted NSGA-II, where
  several mechanisms to balance the genetic search and local search are employed.
  In the proposed local search, a hierarchical strategy is adopted to handle the three
  objectives, which mainly considers the minimization of makespan, while the concern
  of the other two objectives is reflected in the order of trying all the possible
  actions that could generate the acceptable neighbor. Experimental results on well-known
  benchmark instances show that the proposed MA outperforms significantly two off-the-shelf
  multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and four state-of-the-art algorithms specially
  proposed for the MO-FJSP.
