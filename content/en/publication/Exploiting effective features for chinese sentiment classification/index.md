abstract: 'Features play a fundamental role in sentiment classification. How to effectively
  select different types of features to improve sentiment classification performance
  is the primary topic of this paper. Ngram features are commonly employed in text
  classification tasks; in this paper, sentiment-words, substrings, substring-groups,
  and key-substring-groups, which have never been considered in sentiment classification
  area before, are also extracted as features. The extracted features are then compared
  and analyzed. To demonstrate generality, we use two authoritative Chinese data sets
  in different domains to conduct our experiments. Our statistical analysis of the
  experimental results indicate the following: (1) different types of features possess
  different discriminative capabilities in Chinese sentiment classification; (2) character
  bigram features perform the best among the Ngram features; (3) substring-group features
  have greater potential to improve the performance of sentiment classification by
  combining substrings of different lengths; (4) sentiment words or phrases extracted
  from existing sentiment lexicons are not effective for sentiment classification;
  (5) effective features are usually at varying lengths rather than fixed lengths.'
