abstract: Finding the weakness of the products from the customers’ feedback can help
  manufacturers improve their product quality and competitive strength. In recent
  years, more and more people express their opinions about products online, and both
  the feedback of manufacturers’ products or their competitors’ products could be
  easily collected. However, it’s impossible for manufacturers to read every review
  to analyze the weakness of their products. Therefore, finding product weakness from
  online reviews becomes a meaningful work. In this paper, we introduce such an expert
  system, Weakness Finder, which can help manufacturers find their product weakness
  from Chinese reviews by using aspects based sentiment analysis. An aspect is an
  attribute or component of a product, such as price, degerm, moisturizing are the
  aspects of the body wash products. Weakness Finder extracts the features and groups
  explicit features by using morpheme based method and Hownet based similarity measure,
  and identify and group the implicit features with collocation selection method for
  each aspect. Then utilize sentence based sentiment analysis method to determine
  the polarity of each aspect in sentences. The weakness of product could be found
  because the weakness is probably the most unsatisfied aspect in customers’ reviews,
  or the aspect which is more unsatisfied when compared with their competitor’s product
  reviews. Weakness Finder has been used to help a body wash manufacturer find their
  product weakness, and our experimental results demonstrate the good performance
  of the Weakness Finder.
