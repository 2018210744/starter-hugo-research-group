abstract: Effective task scheduling, which is essential for achieving high performance
  of parallel processing, remains challenging despite of extensive studies. In this
  paper, a heuristic-based hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed for solving the
  heterogeneous multiprocessor scheduling problem. The proposed algorithm extends
  traditional GA-based approaches in three aspects. First, it incorporates GA with
  Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), a local search metaheuristic, to enhance the
  balance between global exploration and local exploitation of search space. Second,
  two novel neighborhood structures, in which problem-specific knowledge concerned
  with load balancing and communication reduction is utilized, are proposed to improve
  both the search quality and efficiency of VNS. Third, the use of GA is restricted
  to map tasks to processors while an upward-ranking heuristic is introduced to determine
  the task sequence assignment in each processor. Simulation results indicate that
  our proposed algorithm consistently outperforms several state-of-art scheduling
  algorithms in terms of the schedule quality while maintaining high performance within
  a wide range of parameter settings. Further experiments are carried out to validate
  the effectiveness of the hybridized VNS.
