abstract: The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is a generalization of the
  classical job shop scheduling problem (JSP), where each operation is allowed to
  be processed by any machine from a given set, rather than one specified machine.
  In this paper, two algorithm modules, namely hybrid harmony search (HHS) and large
  neighborhood search (LNS), are developed for the FJSP with makespan criterion. The
  HHS is an evolutionary-based algorithm with the memetic paradigm, while the LNS
  is typical of constraint-based approaches. To form a stronger search mechanism,
  an integrated search heuristic, denoted as HHS/LNS, is proposed for the FJSP based
  on the two algorithms, which starts with the HHS, and then the solution is further
  improved by the LNS. Computational simulations and comparisons demonstrate that
  the proposed HHS/LNS shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art algorithms
  on large-scale FJSP problems, and some new upper bounds among the unsolved benchmark
  instances have even been found.
