abstract: "An open problem in machine learning-based sentiment classification is how\
  \ to extract complex features that outperform simple features; figuring out which\
  \ types of features are most valuable is another. Most of the studies focus primarily\
  \ on character or word Ngrams features, but substring-group features have never\
  \ been considered in sentiment classification area before. In this study, the substring-group\
  \ features are extracted and selected for sentiment classification by means of transductive\
  \ learning-based algorithm. To demonstrate generality, experiments have been conducted\
  \ on three open datasets in three different languages: Chinese, English and Spanish.\
  \ The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm's performance is usually\
  \ superior to the best performance in related work, and the proposed feature subsumption\
  \ algorithm for sentiment classification is multilingual. Compared to the inductive\
  \ learning-based algorithm, the experimental results also illustrate that the transductive\
  \ learning-based algorithm can significantly improve the performance of sentiment\
  \ classification. As for term weighting, the experiments show that the ``tfidf-c''\
  \ outperforms all other term weighting approaches in the proposed algorithm."
