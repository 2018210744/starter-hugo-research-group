abstract: In this paper, a novel hybrid harmony search (HHS) algorithm based on the
  integrated approach, is proposed for solving the flexible job shop scheduling problem
  (FJSP) with the criterion to minimize makespan. First of all, to make the harmony
  search (HS) algorithm adaptive to the FJSP, the converting techniques are developed
  to convert the continuous harmony vector to a kind of discrete two-vector code for
  the FJSP. Secondly, the harmony vector is mapped into a feasible active schedule
  through effectively decoding the transformed two-vector code, which could largely
  reduce the search space. Thirdly, a resultful initialization scheme combining heuristic
  and random strategies is introduced to make the initial harmony memory (HM) occur
  with certain quality and diversity. Furthermore, a local search procedure is embedded
  in the HS algorithm to enhance the local exploitation ability, whereas HS is employed
  to perform exploration by evolving harmony vectors in the HM. To speed up the local
  search process, the improved neighborhood structure based on common critical operations
  is presented in detail. Empirical results on various benchmark instances validate
  the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm. Our work also indicates
  that a well designed HS-based method is a competitive alternative for addressing
  the FJSP.
