abstract: Twitter, the global social networking microblogging service, allows registered
  users to post 140-character messages known as tweets. People use the hashtag symbol
  `#' before a relevant keyword or phrase in their tweets to categorize the tweets
  and help them show more easily in a Twitter search. However, there are very few
  tweets contain hashtags, which impedes the quality of the search results and their
  applications. Therefore, how to automatically generate or recommend hashtags has
  become a particularly important academic research problem. Although many attempts
  have been made for solving this problem, previous methods mostly do not take the
  dynamic nature of hashtags into consideration. Furthermore, most previous work focuses
  on exploiting the similarity between tweets and ignores semantics in tweets.
