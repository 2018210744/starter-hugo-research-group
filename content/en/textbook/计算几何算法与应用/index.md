title: "Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications"
weight: 4
summary: 'The first four chapters of "Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications (3rd Edition)" discuss geometric algorithms, including geometric intersection, triangulation, linear programming, etc. The random algorithm involved is also "Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications (Third Edition)" a distinctive feature. Chapters 5 to 10 introduce a variety of geometric structures. Chapters 11 to 16 continue to discuss several geometric algorithms and their data structures based on practical problems, they are also further deepening of the content of the first 10 chapters. "Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications (3rd Edition)" is not only comprehensive in content, but also closely related to practical applications, with prominent points. It has in-depth explanations, and each chapter has "notes and comments" and "exercises" for the convenience of readers A deeper understanding has been used as teaching materials by many universities around the world.'
